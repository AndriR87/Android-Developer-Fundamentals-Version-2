# Additional Notes
* __Android Version:__ Varies from project to project
* __Android Studio Version:__ 3.1.4
* __Gradle Version:__ 4.4
* __Target SDK Version:__ Varies from project to project

Projects which are completed have some notes within parentheses after the project listing.
Projects for section 1.1 to 3.3 are from version 1 of the course. Not repeated because of similarities. These projects are mostly the same as version 2 but with minor changes. Projects after section 3.3 are from version 2 of the course. 
Also note that this repository is a work in progress and I will be adding more tasks and coding challenges as I finish them.

__Note:__ I will upload projects for version 1 of the course if they are dissimilar to the ones already uploaded. The version 1 projects will be provided in a seperate repository.
